# Data Gathering

This folder contains all scripts, configurations, and data related to the process of gathering movie information for our master database.

## Purpose

The data gathering process is responsible for collecting, cleaning, and preparing movie data from various sources to ensure our master database is accurate and up-to-date.

## Folder Structure

- `scripts/` - Contains scripts for scraping, API calls, and data extraction.
- `raw-data/` - Raw data files collected from sources before processing.
- `processed-data/` - Cleaned and formatted data ready for integration into the master database.

## Usage

1. Run the appropriate scripts in the `scripts/` folder to gather data.
2. Store raw data in `raw-data/`.
3. Process raw data as needed and save the results in `processed-data/`.
4. Review and validate the processed data before database integration.

## Notes

- Ensure API keys and sensitive information are kept secure and not committed to version control.
